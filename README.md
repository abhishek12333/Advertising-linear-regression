# Advertising-Budget-vs-Sales---Linear-Regression
# Linear Regression with Advertising Data

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspapers. The project uses the *Advertising dataset* and deploys a web application using *Streamlit* for real-time sales predictions.

## Features
- *Data Visualization*: Scatter plots showing the relationship between advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and sales.
- *Model Evaluation*: Display of performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² (coefficient of determination).
- *Sales Prediction*: User-friendly interface where users can input advertising budgets to get predicted sales.

## Requirements
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- streamlit

## You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

*## How to Run*
Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run car_price_prediction_app.py
Open your web browser and go to the provided URL (typically http://localhost:8501).
Use the input form to enter data and get a car price prediction.
